About PrOMMiS
-------------

PrOMMiS (Process Optimization and Modeling for Minerals Sustainability) is an NETL-led
multi-institutional collaboration building a framework and modeling platform to enable design
choices with costing, to perform process optimization, and to accelerate development and deployment
of extraction and purification processes for critical minerals/rare earth elements at reduced
risk. PrOMMiS integrates NETL- associated process tools and models from the Institute for Design of
Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES), Carbon Capture Simulation Initiative (CCSI) and other programs, and
leverages current and recently completed projects as case studies for testing and validation.
